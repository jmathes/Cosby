"""
As the NetHack bot is able to go deeper into the dungeon,
it becomes important for it to be sure to know which level it is on.
This module provides a very high level view of the dungeon topology.

Here are some assumptions for the current bot:
    - The branch of each level is one of {BRANCH_MINES, BRANCH_DOOM, BRANCH_SOKOBAN}.
    - Going down a staircase always leads somewhere one level deeper.
    - Going up a staircase leads somewhere one level shallower except for the up staircase in the top level.

Here are some operations:
    - staircase descent (old level object, new ansi)
    - staircase ascent (old level object, new ansi)
    - uncontrolled level change (old level, new dlvl, new ansi)

Dungeon constraints:
    - doom fork is on dlvl {2, 3, 4}
    - oracle is on dlvl {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
    - rogue is on dlvl {15, 16, 17, 18}
    - minetown is on doom fork + {3, 4}
    - mines end is on doom fork + {8, 9}
